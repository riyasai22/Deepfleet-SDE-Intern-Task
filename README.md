The task involves developing a software system for managing Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the context of sales and product categories. The system should facilitate the following functionalities:

Set GST Rates for Product Categories: Users should be able to define and set various GST rates for different product categories. For example, they can assign a 5% GST rate for "Food," 10% for "Footwear," and 20% for "Electronics."

Create Product Categories: The system should allow users to create different product categories. Product categories are essential for organizing and classifying products.

Record Product Sales: Users should have the ability to record the sale of products. When a product is selected, the system should automatically calculate the applicable tax rate based on the product's category.

Generate a Detailed Bill: In a single bill, there may be multiple products from various categories. The system should generate a final bill that clearly displays the products, their respective tax rates, and calculates the total tax amount accordingly. The final bill should provide an overview of the purchase with a breakdown of taxes.
